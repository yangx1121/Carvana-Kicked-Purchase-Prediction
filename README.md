# Carvana-Kicked-Purchase-Prediction

## Project Description:
* Kaggle Competition, Ranked #129/570
* Time: May 2018
* Participant: Xuan Yang, Sahar Sohofi, Florence Wu
* Overview: Used data on previous purchases to find out if each purchase of used car is a good or a bad purchase through supervised learning, and trained the model built to predict good/bad purchases for future deals through SAS JMP

## Procedures:
* Collected data from website, stored as CSV format files, imported data into SAS JMP; 
* Cleaned data like imputation and recoding missing value, data type transformation, data subset; 
* Conducted Principal Component Analysis; 
* Partitioned training and validation data; 
* Built supervised predictive model like logistics regression, decision tree, neutral network, boosted tree and bootstrap forest model; 
* Adjusted cut-off value for reducing misclassification rate and compared confusion matrix, AUC, RMSE; 
* Selected best model and obtained prediction formulas; 
* Contributed to final presentation and report writing.
